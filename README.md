## Description
Quoridor is a board game for 2-4 players where each pawn tries to reach the opposite end of the board. With each turn, players can choose to place a wall or move their pawn. 

This project consists of a simulation of quoridor game play between 2 players. The data from these simulations was recorded and used to make this tableau dashboard:

## Running the simulation
To run, you need python installed on your computer, then run GameSystem.py to see the results of a round of Quoridor.
